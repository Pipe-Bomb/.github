## Pipe Bomb makes it easy for music-oriented businesses like radio stations to discover music and manage their libraries with as little friction as possible.

To do this Pipe Bomb pulls music from multiple streaming services including Youtube Music and SoundCloud which creates the largest music library on the planet.

Pipe Bomb's architecture also allows for organizations to self-host every component of the ecosystem, including [Pipe Bomb servers](https://github.com/Pipe-Bomb/Pipe-Bomb-Server).
